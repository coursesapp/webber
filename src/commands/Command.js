/*
this should be allllll command that related to monitor ...> i  mean every thing related to control the state 
we have two level of control : 1- control by state dispatcher (for states) 2- manipulate DOM 
All Dom manipulate related to generated website are done heeeere 
manipulations like the way of change the styles , or menu context or setting , or the GUI dont happen here 
in another words , here is the result displayed in the monitor 
we don't put in our mind how this change is caused or created .
So focus only on making the result here 
** Make all possible results , man **
-- it will be interesting to manipulete states , and wiil be challenging (not that degree) to change the UI --
-- First we focus on UI --
-- Then we scale it manipulate page data , backend serves , make routers(navigation) --
-- first make sure the ui is ok --> the scale it --> then go to services in clear mind ðŸ˜Š -- 
-- i think commands can take three days to complete --
1- add grid item 
2- delete grid item 
3- update grid item (grid options only)
